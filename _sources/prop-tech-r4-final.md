London Borough of Tower Hamlets has developed a Housing Development Tracker with the help of ESRI online dashboards. The tracker aimed to develop a web-based monitoring tool to keep a track of developments in London Borough of Tower Hamlets and employ ML (machine learning) to understand future development potential. This tool has brought together the housing trajectory for the borough from 2019 to 2030.   


Objectives- To coalesce, summarise, and make available development information captured by LBTH teams in one place. Build on LBTH internal data repository to ensure robustness, integrity, and completeness of data. Develop a machine learning model to understand the scale of future development.

The user can interact with the site by clicking on the site's directory on the left. Once a site has been clicked on the number of units that have been approved on the site appear in the top boxes (eg: here, Wood Wharf has 143 affordable units). The pop-up window provides the user with additional information including LBTH planning application reference, the site status (approved/ commenced/ completed/ stalled), approval date and financial year, completion date and financial year, number of days to complete.
