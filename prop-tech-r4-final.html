<p>London Borough of Tower Hamlets has developed a Housing Development Tracker with the help of ESRI online dashboards. The tracker aimed to develop a web-based monitoring tool to keep a track of developments in London Borough of Tower Hamlets and employ ML (machine learning) to understand future development potential. This tool has brought together the housing trajectory for the borough from 2019 to 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong><br>
To coalesce, summarise, and make available development information captured by LBTH teams in one place. Build on LBTH internal data repository to ensure robustness, integrity, and completeness of data. Develop a machine learning model to understand the scale of future development.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><u>Housing Development Dashboard:</u> the tracker provides an overview of the borough housing trajectory from 2019 to 2030 (483 sites).</p>
 <ul>
     <li>The tracker is designed and developed using ESRI GIS dashboards.<br>
         On this dashboard, the sites and units are classified by: </li>       
         <ul>
             <li>Tenure types: such as market, affordable rent, social rent, intermediate rent, student accommodation, and co-living units.</li>
             <li>Status of site: approved commenced,</li>
             <li>Date of completion, where sites coming forward do not have dates added.</li>
         </ul>
     <li>The database powering the dashboard took close to four months to complete and was brought together using manual system extraction processes from existing databases hosted by Idox as well as human checks of statutory reports.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ol>

    <img src="./_static/FlowImages/Picture1.bmp" />
  </a>
</p>
<p>The user can interact with the site by clicking on the site’s directory on the left. Once a site has been clicked on the number of units that have been approved on the site appear in the top boxes (eg: here, Wood Wharf has 143 affordable units). The pop-up window provides the user with additional information including LBTH planning application reference, the site status (approved/ commenced/ completed/ stalled), approval date and financial year, completion date and financial year, number of days to complete.</p>

</ol>
<p>Once the user clicks on the link from above, they are led to the reporting tool that is setup- the user needs to request PBC team for login credentials. Once logged in the user can download all site related information from the site in excel format. The report is run according to site status- reports downloaded according to sites approved, commenced, completed, stalled, or all.<br>
The site has been set up using FME and supported by the same dataset that powers the housing development tracker interface. The report setup has been configured after user research to respond to council team requests and can be reconfigured in the future.</p>

<p>Onboarding and training: No onboarding and training exercises were required for the suppliers</p>
<p><strong>Overall challenges</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Procurement timelines:</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Internal delays: Identifying teams within the council and allocating right resources in legal and procurement teams after the transfer of award funds from MHCLG posed a considerable delay. (one month)</li>
            <li>Identifying and understanding frameworks: after legal teams were allocated to the project, identifying the correct procurement routes for suppliers took close to two months to identify and understand frameworks. Further clarification with teams within PBC regarding project scope that may affect legal terms also posed major setbacks in overall timeline.</li>
            <li>Training: Exchange on contract with the help of internal procurement system for direct award required training of team staff.</li>
            <li>Contracts: Final exchange of contracts required review cycles and were passed among IT, PBC, and legal teams- all clarifications regarding sections postponed supplier start dates.</li>
        </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Overcoming challenges</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Communication with supplier: both supplier teams were informed regarding the internal delays that affected the project timelines. Council teams met with the supplier teams regularly to convey the status of progress, understand the effects of the delay, and design possible next steps that would help to mitigate these delays and not affect the deliverables in any manner.</li>
    <li>Adjusted project timelines to meet delivery requirements: project timelines were adjusted to design sprint sessions that would deliver parts of the project.</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Sessions with Arup: A total of two sprint workshops and several meetings (between 30 mins and an hour) were held around the year to discuss project steps. The two sprint sessions focussed on user research and user testing for the housing development tracker dashboard built by council teams.</li>
            <li>Sessions with Avineon Tensing: a total of three sprint workshops (1 day sessions) and five meetings (an hour) were designed to deliver-</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>FME extraction tool for reporting and</li>

                </ol>
        </ol>
</ol>
<p><strong>Overall experience</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Although there were significant delays in the procurement process and onboarding exercise teams were able to mitigate potential risks faced due to consistent, transparent communication with project partners.</li>
    <li>In retrospect, had there been a communication regarding the procurement delays being commonplace it would have been easier for LPA teams to accommodate timelines and project expectations.</li>

<p><b>The HDT project scope covered:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>To deliver Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Housing development Tracker (HDT)</li>
    <li>Build a housing trajectory that collates all housing development 2019 onwards</li>
    <li>Create and build a planning data schema for LBTH</li>
    <li>Develop ML methodologies to forecast development potential</li>
    <li>And map next steps to scale and expand the HDT</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Data Cleanse</b></li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Designed as week-long sprints with daily end of day huddle sessions. Managed and delivered by core team in planning and building control.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><b>Product Specifications</b></li>
        <ol type="a" start="2">
            <li>User Research and User Testing:</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>User Research Sessions were run in two phases- initial data discovery that scoped the product data schema and deep delved with teams to understand housing development processes and data flows.
                    The sessions were conducted as focused group discussions, team interviews, and individual interviews. All sessions helped to scope product data schema, map housing processes in the council, and design key requirements of housing tracker.</li>
                    <li>User Testing: from User Research sessions individuals in key teams were requested to review and comment on first dashboard iteration. The sessions were designed as individual interview sessions that keyed in questions on design and functionality, search options, navigation, and general comments. Reviews from user testing sessions were then discussed within core team and GIS analyst to implement into iteration 2 for HDT- the final MVP.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Dashboard Design: The HDT dashboard has been designed using ESRI GIS dashboard libraries.Delivered in two iterations- initial test version as a result of user research and data cleanse and final after user testing (MVP). Maps and widgets were designed to resonate council team requests to view key housing figures listed by tenure and bedroom size, planning application details, development status, size, and development location.</li>
            <li>Integration into council webpage (implementation for council team view): this was carried out by the web team for LBTH who were requested to add a button leading to the GIS dashboard. The URL address for the same was shared with the team and was quick to setup. This last step made the dashboard available throughout the council for review and feedback.</li>
        </ol>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
    <li>Sessions with suppliers</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Workshops with Arup were designed to direct user research and user testing methodologies. Discussions shaped approach to user research, outlined open-ended questions that helped define deliverables for HDT.</li>
            <li>Workshops were designed with Avineon Tensing to produce and deliver the FME report extraction tool and test with automated data extraction. Several meetings were held leading to the workshop that helped design the two-day sprint session to deliver the extraction tool. The final day was spent in understanding the ability of FME to automate data processing from the planning reports using Google Gemini Ai- this session helped guide the future scope for project future.</li>
        </ol>
</ol>
<p>Approach prior to HDT: Reports were regularly created by extracting data from planning and building control systems to be cleansed, manually checked and corrected, and circulated on a periodic basis and on request.</p>

<p><strong>Key challenges and lessons learnt:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Procurement processes posed a major challenge to project timeline- there were several project delays that were mitigated with supplier support. Although the delays were not welcome, they added to the overall understanding of the procurement process for PBC Digital and Data team that has been newly formed. The relatively smaller scale procurement for this project also helped to understand how larger projects should or could be navigated through. The work also helped identify key persons and teams to be contacted during procurement processes, delays, and issues. Lastly guiding team to understand procurement frameworks available in the PBC consultation processes for future references.
<br></p></li>
<li><p>Data cleanse process: Although LBTH data management systems and planning applications are accurate, the data collected is immense and required much manual checking. For example, a site Wood Wharf has over 3000 approved units in its residential mix that is spread over 500 applications. Several human hours were spent in collating and reorienting this data to match applications to sites for close to 500 sites in the trajectory of LBTH as delivered in the HDT. The extended processes were a result of the way in which the data was captured as opposed to the way in which data is requested. This initial manual cleanse helped to understand and strategize how data added to the system needs to be reoriented and directed the need to build a planning data schema. Additionally, the processes in the manual cleanse also helped to outline the rules and conditions for automating extractions using FME- which is scoped to be explored further in the next stages of the product.
<br></p></li>
<li><p>ML Scope: the HDT product had proposed in the funding BID complete machine learning model experimentation. Although, during the project as the planning schema was being identified and iterated on- there has been considerable effort to identify all key variables along with their associated units and appropriate indexing, to understand what a planning schema looks like beyond the application logging and site process. This approach rather than delaying the experimentation process has better defined the planning schema and the extraneous variables affecting housing delivery in the live environment (such as cost of living, interest rate, pandemic, etc). The delay has helped to create a clear and direct approach to experimentation and fed into further scope of the future of the product as well as the LBTH PBC digital and data strategies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Experience and overall learning:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Council data requests require immediate results but resolving and reorienting the data to respond to all requests is a long-term project. The HDT product has helped to identify this common issue and highlight the need for it to be addressed. The project has also helped garner long term commitments towards data integrity and interoperability goals.
<br></p></li>
<li><p>Newly formed, the PBC Data Management Team has been able to define the trajectory and strategies for future of LBTH planning data during the implementation of the project. The team has also been able to acquire and train staff on diverse skills in procurement, market analysis, consultation scope, coding that helped to extend the ambit of their business-as-usual work.</p></li>

<h3>Housing Discovery Project<a class="headerlink" href="#housing-discovery-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
As a part of the housing development tracker user research was conducted to identify and respond to the council’s business needs that helped scope the MVP for the housing development tracker. Teams interviewed helped identify the processes of housing in the council- information triggers, definitions, data flow. This led to the Housing Discovery Project that eventually helped map all housing processes in the council.</p>
<p><strong>Teams interviewed:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Development Management</li>
    <li>Building Control</li> 
    <li>Street Naming and Numbering</li>
    <li>PBC Divisional Support</li>
    <li>Council Tax</li>
    <li>Environment</li>
    <li>Waste</li>
    <li>Capital Delivery</li>
    <li>Land Assessment</li>
    <li>(Affordable) Housing Supply</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Focus group discussions</li>
    <li>Team Interviews</li>
</ol>
<p>Members from teams in council that participate in housing related developments directly (from application submission to monitoring after completion) were interviewed in random groups, team clusters, individually. Questions were centred around the team’s BAU process to identify the data that they generate as well as the action that triggers their data. As a result, the team interviews informed the housing data flow processes. The results were recorded through process charts for each team which further branched out to the data the team’s work produced and the key definitions and that their work trigger.</p>

<h2>Next steps<a class="headerlink" href="#next-steps" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><small><em>Outline any plans or strategies for further applications of these tools or broader adoption. Please offer your views on the scalability of your project or tools and share any plans for further integration in or outside of your council.

<p><strong>Next steps:</strong>
Evolving the planning database to forecast development potential with the help of machine learning methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li><u>Building a complete planning database</u></li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Develop a complete planning database schema</li><br>
            <p>At the end of this MVP, the planning data schema has been able to identify and assimilated key housing development variables including tenure, bedroom size, wheelchair accessibility, all application numbers (planning, building control, street naming and numbering), council tax band, EPC grade, key dates (approval, commencement, completion), days taken for development to complete, scale of development, live status of development, and other at unit level. The database conforms to all things within the development and is working on association with things around it that affect its life- including proximity transport, open spaces, amenities, as well as interest rates at time of completion. The aim of the schema is to identify factors intrinsic and extrinsic to a development that affect its life with maximum precision.</p></li>
            <br>
            <li>Automating unstructured data extraction process with FME (Feature Manipulation Engine)</li><br>
            FME feature extraction tool was tested during the MVP stage to process an application’s documents (delegated report, section 106, deed of variation) to extract residential information. The results aided team to consider automation processes for future iterations to complete PBC business-as-usual residential data collection requirements as well as planning database development as stated above (a).</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <br>
    <li><u>Using machine learning tools to forecast development potential</u></li><br>During the development of this MVP, a test planning database was created (subset to the planning database schema in 1a) that considered all developments in trajectory to examine effect of factors intrinsic and extrinsic to development that affected days taken to deliver development. The test case looked at factors influencing completed developments (using methods such multi-linear regression; principal component analysis) and built scenarios to test against approved and commenced developments. The future iterations for the project would take these forwards and keep experimenting with other machine learning methods as the planning database is expanded.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Producing a machine learning tool to predict housing development potential.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Transforming data collection, cleansing, and transformation process using FME extraction tool- to automate and cleanse data at source.</p></li>
</ol>
<p align="center">
  <a href="./_static/FlowImages/BAU_Future.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="./_static/FlowImages/BAU_Future.png" />
  </a>
</p> 
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Developing HDT website further to assimilate and share results of housing data flow diagram (in html format)- making available all housing processes, key definitions, triggers of information (data) for all teams in council.
<br></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Scalability and future integration:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Assessing development potential is a universal exercise. The methodology developed by LBTH to identify and implement forecasting tools could be replicated across most high-growth LPAs, particularly those in London.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, several hours are spent by LPAs on compiling the yearly housing trajectory, starts and completion, and the AMR. Using text automation processes developed by LBTH teams could read through unstructured text to bring together key planning data in a database format. While the FME (feature manipulation extraction) process is not a copy/paste code, other LPAs willing to recreate this would not have to work through initial methodology phases to condition the tool. The council team would as a part of project output create and share basic steps required to implement automation processes for other councils to consider.</p></li>
